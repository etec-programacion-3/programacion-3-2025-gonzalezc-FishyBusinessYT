There are a fixed amount of classes, bodies and kits. These could be "hard-coded"
in a sense, and not necessarily be stored in the database, as they share most 
data points with creature bodies and pretty much all they accomplish is a flat
increase of the creature's stats and/or addition of passive features, actions 
and/or items.

Even as classes and kits increase specific stats, these stats can then be
redistributed in specific ways. This, in turn, means that in reality there's
several "pools" of points awarded by classes and kits that creature designers
can use as they please. This simplifies things a lot. The pools are as follows:

* Main stat pool for SHP, DHP and Stamina.
* Subtrait pool for all 12 subtraits.
* Block and Dodge Ratings pool.
* Defense pool for all 5 defense types.

Let's take, for example, the defense kit:
+5 SHP
+5 DHP
+4 any single defense
+1d4 Block or +1d12 Dodge

Taking the previous "pool" design into account, this kit would work like this:
+10 Main stat points
+4 defense points
+1 B&D Ratings points
